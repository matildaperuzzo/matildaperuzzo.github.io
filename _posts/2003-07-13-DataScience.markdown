        <div class="cv-section">
        <p>During my doctoral research in quantum physics, I encountered a bottleneck in the data analysis process. The Python library I initially employed for fitting data to complex systems proved to be inefficient, particularly for the large datasets inherent in quantum experiments.</p>
        <p>Seeking a solution, I embarked on a collaboration and ventured into learning Julia, a programming language known for its efficiency in scientific computing. Julia's optimization capabilities and efficient linear algebra operations offered a significant improvement over the Python library. The speed at which Julia processed and fitted the data was several orders of magnitude faster, enabling rapid extraction of insights from extensive datasets. As a result, I uncovered nuanced characteristics of the system that were previously obscured. </p>
        <p>This experience underscored the value of collaboration and the importance of exploring alternative tools in scientific research. Learning Julia for this project was instrumental in accelerating the data analysis process and revealing novel insights into the physics of the system.</p>

description2: </p>
        <div class="cv-section">
        <p>This project was a collaboration with a biologist, the primary objective was to provide quantitative data analysis for her study. The dataset consisted of microscopy videos capturing the post-fertilization movement of cortical fluids in ascidian cells, exhibiting different fluorescence frequency levels. My task involved extracting key metrics such as the cell's radius of curvature, fluorescence intensity distribution, and fluid speed from the 2D images.</p>

        <p>To analyze the data, I utilized Python programming, developing algorithms for image processing. The process involved fitting the data to a custom function to extract cell walls, followed by calculating essential parameters like curvature and speed. This approach enabled us to produce quantitative insights into the biological processes under study.</p>

        <p>The collaboration underscored the significance of interdisciplinary cooperation and was an enriching experience. Our findings were documented in a published paper, highlighting the value of combining expertise from different fields to advance scientific research.</p>
